\title{Add a set of fixed loadings to a flash fit object}
\usage{
flash_add_fixed_l(data, LL, f_init = NULL, fixl = NULL,
  init_fn = "udv_si")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a flash data object}

\item{LL}{the loadings, an n by K matrix. Missing values will be initialized by the mean of the relevant column (but will generally be
re-estimated when refitting the model).}

\item{f_init}{a flash fit object to which loadings are to be added (if NULL then a new fit object is created)}

\item{fixl}{an n by K matrix of TRUE/FALSE values indicating which elements of LL should be considered fixed and not changed during updates.
Default is to fix all non-missing values, so missing values will be updated when f is updated.}
}
\value{
a flash fit object, with loadings initialized from LL, and corresponding factors initialized to 0.
}
