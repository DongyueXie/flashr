\title{set up data for reading into flash}
\usage{
set_flash_data(Y, S = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{an n by p data matrix}

\item{S}{an n by p matrix of the standard errors of observations of Y.
(Can be a scalar if all elements of the matrix are equal.)
Currently S is ignored as we have not yet implemented methods for this.}
}
\value{
a flash data object
}
\details{
Y can have missing data, but no column or row can be entirely missing
The flash data object contains flags for dealing with missing data
and a (naively) imputed version of the original data matrix so that
i) some of the initializatinon methods used by flash (eg svd) do not fail
ii) data$Y * data$missing is 0 if the original data were missing
